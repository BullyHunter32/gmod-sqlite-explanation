SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases. It can be extremely useful when storing sensitive 
information about a player such as ban records, darkrp money, logs and others of this nature.


1) How to use sqlite within garrysmod.

Garrysmod already has an implemented database (one for each realm/state) and has an sql lib ready to be used so there is nothing you need to install.
The function that is used to execute sql queries is

```
sql.Query( string query )
```

2) Usage

Before you can use sqlite you need to have a table that you can use.
In this example we will create one for storing people's steamid.

We can create a table by using the key words 'CREATE TABLE' but it would better to use 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS' so it does not overwrite any tables.
In a query it would look like this,
```
sql.Query("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS steamid_saver( SteamID TEXT , Name TEXT )")
```
The two parameters given are SteamID with the data type TEXT (string) and also their Name which is also stored as a string.


You can insert values into this table using the `INSERT` keyword. In this example I will store their name and steamid when they spawn in.
I'll use the PlayerInitSpawn hook for this.

```
hook.Add("PlayerInitSpawn","SteamID_Saver",function( pPlayer )
    if sql.Query("SELECT * FROM steamid_saver WHERE SteamID='%s'"):format( pPlayer:SteamID64() ) then 
        print( pPlayer:Name(), " is already stored!")
        return 
    end
    
    sql.Query("INSERT INTO steamid_saver( SteamID , Name ) VALUES( '%s' , '%s' "):format( -- Its more convenient to format the string so it doesn't ge messy.
        pPlayer:SteamID64(),
        pPlayer:Name()
    )
end)
```

If we wanted to lookup a steamid within the database we would use the 'SELECT' and 'WHERE' keywords.
The syntax for finding specific data is 'SELECT <values> FROM <tablename> WHERE <condition>'
We can create a function for this to make it easier to fetch data instead of using sql.Query every time.

function getNameBySteamID( SteamID64 )
    local query = sql.Query("SELECT Name from steamid_saver WHERE SteamID='%s'"):format( SteamID64 )
    if query then
        return query[1].Name -- When selecting data from a database you are returned a table of tables which meet the condition
    end
    return "Player not found!"
end
